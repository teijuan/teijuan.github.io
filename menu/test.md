ðŸŽ¼ My Cocoon  
ðŸŽ¤ by Bes feat. Meret

You shouldâ€²ve known me, I know it all  
There was the evil and righteous soul  
I spun a web of my own truth  
Black and white world in my cocoon
  
All charades I built for me  
Started crumbling when you came  
It was before I even knew  
You drew me out of my cocoon

You drew me out of my cocoon
