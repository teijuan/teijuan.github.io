## Welcome! \\(^^)/

I'm **Tei Juan**, a 22 y. male artist known mainly for drawing pregnant critters from many species.  
But I also do general works for every age and taste, and if you're coming from FA, invite you to watch [my latest works](https://furaffinity.net/gallery/teixeira-juan/).

2D commissions are my main job. I was 13 years when I sold my first works at elementary school, but I'm able to design 3D models as well, and you might check my most recent ones in the section "[Models](/models)" above.
