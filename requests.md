No, I don't do art requests.  


\- Why, you ask?  
Art has costs. Not only for the customer, but for the artist as well:
- **Physical** and **mental effort**;  
- **Material and financial resources**;  
- **Time**.


I do offer commissions instead. You can check my ToS [right here][tos] and [contact me][contact] for commissioning or just further info.
