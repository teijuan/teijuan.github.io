# <https://teijuan.github.io>

It's a brand new website I've been working on, that seems to work better than [the Netlify one](https://teijuan.netlify.app/), and every info about commissions and contact from the old site were moved to this github address.

I also expect to publish most of updates about my art jobs here (like a new promo or project), saving time spend in copypasting the same texts into every page and reformatting according to the site's rules. (Like I did seconds before posting this journal.)

Since the feed is [RSS-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), **anyone** can view my posts without having to look through a specific site like Furaffinity or Twitter, from **two ways**:

- Searching directly in this site's blog section (Homepage)
- Copying the ["Subscribe"](https://teijuan.github.io/feed.xml) button link and pasting into a RSS reader app.

Yeah folks, that's all!

\~ Tei.
