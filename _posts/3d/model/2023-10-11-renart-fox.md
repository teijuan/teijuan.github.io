Renart the Fox is the main protagonist of a classic tale and 2005's CGI film ["Le Roman de Renart"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436710/).  
His design was originally created by **Emmanuel Perez**.

Quite remember Disney's Robin Hood, however, Renny's pursuit for wealth is to simply make a decent living for him, his wife and children.
