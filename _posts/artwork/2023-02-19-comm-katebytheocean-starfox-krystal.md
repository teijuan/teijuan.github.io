> "It was only a matter of time until Tricky’s prediction came true. Fox and Krystal celebrated hard after the defeat of the Aparoids. However, in their excitement, both forgot to use any protection. This came back to haunt Krystal in the months that followed. She loved Fox though, and felt blessed to be carrying his children. She quickly got into the swing of living life as a pilot mother-to-be, and soon she was a sight to behold on Great Fox. That is, until she grew out of her flight suit. Good thing requisitions exist, and the fact that Star Fox provides pregnancy accommodating flight suits. Now, just weeks before the arrival of the next generation of heroes, Krystal is eager to show them around the stars in the cockpit of her Arwing."

Let’s just hope the babies don’t decide to want to come out while she’s flying ^^;
