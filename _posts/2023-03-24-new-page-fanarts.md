Hey, I did a new page for indexing arts of my characters received from trades, gifts or simply fanarts:  

## <https://teijuan.github.io/fanarts/>

If you drew some of my characters and want your work appearing on the site, just send me its link or image file to [my email](mailto:tei-juan@hotmail.com) or DMs and I'll include it for you.  

> Note: The page from the old site had some missing thumbnails. Those were fixed and now every of them are showing correctly.
