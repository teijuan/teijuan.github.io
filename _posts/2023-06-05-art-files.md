If you opened or received some artwork of mine as a commission or part of trade, might have noticed a kind of pattern on the filename, which I've explained explain in this article and probably, will save you some time when doing yours if you're an digital artist as well.  

## Take a look at this example:  

```
2019-11-28-comm-daniel-harrier
└1───────┘ └2─┘ └─ 3 ──── 4 ─┘
```

It consists in:  

1. `2019-11-28`  
**Creation date**. It is important to keep file's consistency because will never change, and every new work will always be put on the top or bottom of a digitql stack.

2. `comm`  
Work's **category**. The example is a commission, so it's just called comm. Some others are:

| | |
|---|---|
| **REQU**  | Request |
| **TRADE**  | Art trades   |
| **TEI**  | Art of my OCs done by myself.   |
| **ART**  | General arts / fanarts.   |

> Believe or not, took days 'till defining an acronym for general arts. These things came in mind before:
> - fan  
> - dart  
> - fana  
> - fart \(ºnº \) ... Standing for FanART. How genial.

3. `daniel` and `harrier`   
After the creation date and work category, I put some keywords for summarizing the work, and they respect this order:  
**Username** > **Franchise** > **Character(s) name(s)** > **Scenario**  

Usually there are between 2 and 4 words, no more else or will be much long.  

## Some examples

- `2022-11-18-art-badguys-diane-mrwolf`  
\- Franchise  
\- Characters' names    

- `2022-12-22-art-donbluth-mrsbrisby-littles`  
\- Franchise or their creator  
\- Main characters' name (since it has other four)  
\- A keyword.    

- `2023-05-15-comm-roji-betty-dupris`  
\- Username  
\- Main character's name and surname.  
Can just keep the first name as well.  

- `2022-11-02-art-splatoon-shiver-nadando`
\- Franchise  
\- Character  
\- What they're doing ("Nadando" is "swimming" in portuguese)

## Benefits

### Sorting

Every file related to some art (project, image, text note) appears together as long as the folder is sorted by name. This is also a bit pleasing visually:  

| ▲ Name | Description | Size | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-12-22-art-donbluth-mrsbrisby-littles-en.jpg | JPG file | ---.MB | 0000-00-00 |

### Search

Looking for artworks of a specific character or for some customer never been so easy to me thanks to this pattern. 

Typing `-judy` on my search bar leads me to these files:    

| ▲ Name | Description | Size | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018-08-15-art-zootopia<u>-judy</u>hopps-sktc.jpg | JPG file | ---.MB | 0000-00-00 |

| 2023-03-20-comm-roji<u>-judy</u>bot-preg.mdp | FireAlpaca  document | ---.MB | 0000-00-00 |
| 2023-03-20-comm-roji<u>-judy</u>bot-preg-roug.jpg | JPG file | ---.MB | 0000-00-00 |

- Comissions of Robo judy for Roji Tanner in 2023  
- Generic traditional sketches done in 2018  

## A name pattern means:
- No more mess and annoyance trying to find some work or cleaning up space on disk. removing redundancies.  
- Less time for sorting and renaming your works, and then, more time for doing them.
