I'll be closed for new comms requests on Dec 25th so I can enjoy holidays, reopening only next year.  

Bunny Year discount will end this day as well, and if there's enough interest, I might do a promo for the **Year of the Dragon** as well.  

I'll also share the terms for commissioning 3d models and possibly, my plans for this brand new project I called "Heavensbake".
