Joshua Bunny. A bunny in a kind of wrestler or space warrior suit. 

Been a long time since I've adopted him from T00NIFY on Twitter, but after a successful rigging experiment, I finally decided to present him.
Hope you like =^w^= 

His model is the first to include som many IK constraints on different parts. So far, he has IK enabled on hands, feet, fingers and pelvis, which can be disabled/enabled through custom properties in a settings bone.
