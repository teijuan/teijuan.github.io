I'm so glad to present one of my first 3d models, a pokemon Lopunny.
It has a full body rig and a few face movable parts.
The mesh is kinda irregular at some parts and the colors has a generic texture, but overall I see a huge progress since I've started learning 3D modeling and animation, which was in late june.
As always, tips and feedbacks are very appreciated.
